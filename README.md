### `The Arrow Function`

Arrow functtion is the shortest way to declare a function.
An arrow function expression is a compact alternative to a traditional function expression,

### `UseState and useEffect Method`

The useState function is a built in hook that can be imported from the react package. 
It allows you to add state to your functional components. Using the useState hook inside a function component,
you can create a piece of state without switching to class components.

What does useEffect do? By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render.
React will remember the function you passed (we'll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later after performing the DOM updates.
